###### Supernatural Map

Project created for the Highfeild Hack 2021 hackathon.

This project takes an area and uses its place names and location data to generate supernatural themed facts. The place names and facts are then marked on an existing map.

This project is designed to be a creative aid. It can be used for helping players to develop narratives for roleplaying games which are set in the real world.
